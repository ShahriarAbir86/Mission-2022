            <h2>Develop <br> Without Limits</h2>
            <p>I started learning how to code four years ago. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build websites and apps. I figured I’d learn what I needed and make some cool stuff to land an entry level developer job. What I didn’t anticipate is how many tools there were to choose from, and there wasn’t much direction on where to start. Choosing a code editor, using the command line, version control, and not to mention learning the tech jargon made it hard to start. <br>
            I can’t tell you how many nights I spun my wheels in the wrong direction learning something I’ve never used. This is what I wish someone would of told me as well as a bunch of great resources to get you started.</p>

            <p>In order to gain confidence and support during Web Development, I have joined many developers community so far. But I couldn't get enough support from these communities. One day I heard about Programming Hero run by Jhankar Mahabub brother. From then I've become Obssesed with this Community. <br>
            Literally, I was surprised with the well-organisation of this community. Thanks Programming Hero for giving us this amazing support and guidance.
